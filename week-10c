Write R program to find Decision 
Tree with the sample data and 
visualize the regression graphically.  
Program: 
# Load the built-in iris dataset 
data(iris) 
# Install and load required libraries 
library(C50) 
library(caTools) 
# Make results reproducible 
set.seed(7) 
# Split data into 70% training and 30% testing 
split <- sample.split(iris$Species, SplitRatio = 0.7) 
training <- subset(iris, split == TRUE) 
testing <- subset(iris, split == FALSE) 
# Build the decision tree model 
model <- C5.0(Species ~ ., data = training) 
# View model summary 
summary(model) 
# Predict on the test data 
pred <- predict(model, testing[,-5]) 
# Calculate accuracy 
a <- table(testing$Species, pred) 
accuracy <- sum(diag(a)) / sum(a) 
print(paste("Accuracy:", round(accuracy, 3))) 
# Visualize the decision tree 
plot(model)
